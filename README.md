Welcome to the open source DnD Online Character Creator. I created this character creator because I really liked the D&D Beyond design, but not the closed nature of most of the races. The other creators either lacked features or were just character sheets. 

The worst part is almost all these other creators *looked terrible*. I want something that looks good, is easy to read AND can be printed easily to use as a paper copy. So I created this!

***NOTE: This creator is still heavily in development and as such most features are unavailable as of yet. Please create an `issue` and use the `suggestion` tag if you want me to add a feature.***

This program is licensed under the GPL-v3.0 License.

## Character Sheet
The Character Sheet is the core of the program, a nicely designed sheet very similar to that of similar designs, including the official D&D Beyond, and Roll20 designs. This sheet is designed to easily printed out too, so if you play in person, you can use it there as well.

## Character Generator
The Character Generator is very similar to that of the D&D Beyond Character Creator. You will be given a step-by-step way of creating your character. This is the easiest way to create your character for new people, as you will also be able to "level" your character along a pre-defined way, as is detailed in the characters stats.

## Custom Races
An important detail of this program will be custom races. People will be able to create their own races, each with stats blocks pre-defined as well as what they get from each level. At this current time, plans for how one would create this will be by editing the JSON file. 
You will be able to share these custom races with others, who can then search them and import them too.

# Roadmap
The current roadmap for development is outline below:
1. Create the Character Sheet
2. Create Character Generator
3. Create Editable Characters
4. Create the Ability to Level Up Characters
5. Allow for Custom Races
6. Create Area for Users to Upload Custom Races

There is still much to do, so please bear with me while I develop this.
